- Windows, reset iface while running, local multicast socket does not rejoin multicast group

- Windows, same host multicast messages come back from different IP, [expected 10.0.1.39] [got 169.254.80.80]

- #BUG1 Android, reset iface while running, sometimes momentarily sees local hosts as global because at that time the iface isn't enumerated, cache

- Immediate departure messages are only sent to found record senders, but some peers may not advertise themselves, cache requesters as well
